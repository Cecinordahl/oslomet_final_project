        <h2>Learning to Code</h2>

        <p>
            It all started with a course at OsloMet called DAPE1400 Programming- a course
            we were able to follow physically and/or virtually, at our own pace, with a few
            stepping stones disguised as 'obligs' on the way.

                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <p>I had never coded until I started as a first year student at OsloMet. In the beginning of the
                            semester I found coding easier,
                            when we were learning what String, int and double were, the differences between them and how
                            they worked. But as we progressed
                            it became more challenging to understand and keep up. Some subjects took longer to understand
                            than others, like when should a
                            method be static and when should it not.

                        <h3>The Ups and Downs</h3>
                        <p>I feel like learning to code and coding in general is like a road with many highs and
                            lows, ups and downs. When you are stuck and don’t understand right away what is wrong in your
                            code or how things work it can be
                            extremely frustrating. But once you finally figure out what’s the problem and have a working
                            code, it can feel like the biggest
                            accomplishment in the world. There have been many instances throughout the semester where I have
                            been sitting with a problem for way too long without a break. But, when you're sitting there, deeply
                            invested in a piece of the code, it is easy to tell yourself that you will take a break soon. But, soon
                            turns out to be much later. I have realized, those times I have forced myself to take a break, I come
                            back with a much clearer head than before.

                        <h3>Finding a Way</h3>
                        <p>
                        Coding is not necessarily about finding the right way but finding a way. Throughout this
                        semester I have realized there are not
                        just one solution to a coding problem, but many of them. One solution may work better than
                        another, but there are still many ways
                        to go about solving problems. This is where I realized problem solving skills are necessary
                             to become a developer. The more exercises I solved throughout the semester, the better
                            and more comfortable I felt solving more advanced problems. To me, problem solving is all
                             about the process of dissecting a large and complex problem into smaller parts.

                            Solving exercises, re-doing exercises that are not clear the first
                        time and reminding myself that we
                        will never stop learning have been the biggest motivator throughout the semester.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Learning to code can for many be a trial and error process. In the end, we will all find our own way but the
            best way I found for myself
            to learn to code was by doing as many exercises and mini-projects as possible. I want to learn more and
            truly understand what I learn.
            I want to be good at this. I hope I one day get to work with coding and developing as a full-time job once I
            graduate from OsloMet.
