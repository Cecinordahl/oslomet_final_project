        Technology and society (with external links):
        Write – or re-use a short text you have previously written – (anywhere
        from 300 to 1000 words) about technology and society. You are allowed
        to reuse text from "DATA1100 Technology and Society for Programmers"
        or other subjects. This text should have multiple links to external sites
        with relevant information. We shall not grade you on how relevant the
        information you link to is, but we expect several links and we expect it to
        be easy to understand before clicking what information you lead us to.
