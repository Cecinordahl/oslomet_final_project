                <h3>Identifying three universally designed aspects of technology that we encounter in our
                daily life and explaining how they make our life easier.</h3>

                <p>As we have seen, the concept behind
                <a href="https://universaldesign.ie/what-is-universal-design/">universal design</a>
                is easy to understand, but can be hard to implement in a practical way. We have a lot of challenges 
                regarding designing something for everyone, no matter 
                <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1">disabilities</a>
                or challenges of different kinds. In this text
                we want to show different forms of universal design and how we get positively affected by
                this. If you want to read more about making universal design a reality, press
                <a href="https://www.oslomet.no/en/research/featured-research/making-universal-design-reality">here.</a></p>
            
                <p>A technological example we want to put first is
                <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1">auto correct</a>.
                Autocorrection is a function which is mainly widespread on phones. This allows the telephone 
                to change words as you type and is often activated as a default option. The phones detect when 
                you have written something grammatically wrong and changes it to the word you were most likely supposed
                to write. This is positive for those that struggles with grammar, but also makes the efficiency
                faster for those who doesn’t have any problems with it. Do you wanna read more about auto correct? press
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrection">here</a>.</p>    
              
                <p>The next universal design we will consider is
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiobook">audiobooks</a>. Audiobooks isn't just easy to use,
                but have become very popular lately. They can be downloaded and be used on most digital
                devices and platforms. If we are to use the terms “temporary handicap” then this is a great
                design that can be used when you don’t have the ability to read a book. Feel like listening to Audibooks? Try
                <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/">Audible.com</a>.
                Situations that are perfect while doing so can be while driving a car, on a walk or when we simply must have your 
                attention and eyes on something else. </p>

                <p>Third and at last we have chosen the stop-announcing system on 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport">public transport</a>. 
                The stopannouncing system is a messaging system which tells us where we are in our route over
                speakers and on a visual way on a screen. If you aren't familiar with the route, have a
                hearing or a visual disability it helps us follow and know where and when to disembark the
                vehicle. It also benefits those who know the area with letting them relax and focus on other
                daily activities.</p>

                <h3>Universal design can act as a useful solution for an aging population. Think about a friend
                or family member who is older. List the top 10 ways that universal design can help them
                live a longer and happier life.</h3>

                <p>Being old often comes with impairments and 
                <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1">disabilities</a>.
                Old women or men will often
                struggle with daily tasks that earlier in their life would be considered easy. Some of these
                can come in form of visual and cognitive impairments or muscles being weakened to
                mention some. It is therefore important to design a world where we take responsibility and
                care for the
                 <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/worlds-older-population-grows-dramatically">dramatically increasing amount of elders</a>.
                A product being universal designed, has to be
                developed such that everyone with or without the same struggles can use them.
                We will now list what we think is solutions that is universal and can help the elders, but also
                aid persons without any form of disability or impairments.</p>
