        <h3>Identifying three universally designed aspects of technology that we encounter in our
            daily life and explaining how they make our life easier.</h3>

        <p>The concept behind
            <a href="https://universaldesign.ie/what-is-universal-design/">universal design</a>
            is easy to understand, but can be hard to implement in a practical way. We have a lot of challenges
            designing something for everyone, no matter
            <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1">disabilities</a>
            or challenges of different kinds.(Nesmith,2016) In this text
            we want to show different forms of universal design and how we get positively affected by
            this. If you want to read more about making universal design a reality, press
            <a href="https://www.oslomet.no/en/research/featured-research/making-universal-design-reality">here.</a>
        </p>

        <p>A technological example we want elaborate on is
            <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1">auto correct</a>.
            Autocorrection is a function which is mainly widespread on phones. This allows the telephone
            to change words as you type and is often activated as a default option. The phones detect when
            you have written something grammatically wrong and changes it to the word you were most likely supposed
            to write. This is positive for those that struggles with grammar, but also makes the efficiency
            faster for those who doesn’t have any problems with it. Do you wanna read more about auto correct? press
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrection">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The second universal design we will consider is
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiobook">audiobooks</a>. Audiobooks isn't just easy to use,
            but have become very popular lately. They can be downloaded and be used on most digital
            devices and platforms. If we are to use the terms “temporary handicap” then this is a great
            design that can be used when you don’t have the ability to read a book. Feel like listening to Audibooks?
            Try
            <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/">Audible.com</a>.
            Situations that are perfect while listening, can be while driving a car, on a walk or when we simply
            must have your
            attention and eyes on something else.
        </p>

        <p>Third and at last we have chosen the stop-announcing system on
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport">public transport</a>.
            The stopannouncing system is a messaging system which tells us where we are in our route over
            speakers and on a visual way. If you aren't familiar with the route, have a
            hearing or a visual disability it helps us follow and know where and when to disembark the
            vehicle. It also benefits those who know the area with letting them relax and focus on other
            daily activities.

        <h3>Universal design can act as a useful solution for an aging population. Think about a friend
            or family member who is older. List the top 10 ways that universal design can help them
            live a longer and happier life.</h3>

        <p>Being old often comes with impairments and
            <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1">disabilities</a>.
            Old women or men will often
            struggle with daily tasks that earlier in their life would be considered easy. Some of these
            can come in form of visual and cognitive impairments or muscles being weakened to
            mention some. It is therefore important to design a world where we take responsibility and
            care for the
            <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/worlds-older-population-grows-dramatically">dramatically
                increasing amount of elders</a>.
            A product being universal designed, has to be
            developed such that everyone with or without the same struggles can use them. (National Disability
            Authority, 2014)
            We will now list what we think is solutions that is universal and can help the elders, but also
            aid persons without any form of disability or impairments.
