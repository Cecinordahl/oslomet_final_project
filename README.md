# oslomet_final_project

Functional requirements
You must implement a website consisting of 5 separate web pages according to
the descriptions provided in Page contents below.
The design ("look and feel" and/or layout) of 4 of these pages should be highly
similar – or consistent across the pages; the 5th page may be different.
The overarching theme of the pages should be your experience as a first
semester student. The content will be given only a little weight in the evaluation.
See general grading criteria in section How we shall grade these final
assignments.
A user who come across your page should easily understand from the front
page (index.html) that you are new students.
All text should be in English or a Scandinavian language, including Sami but not
Finnish, please.

How we shall grade these final assignments
• Structure and navigation, wide screen and small screens: Are the pages
well structured (with headings, paragraphs, images) and is it easy to
navigate between the pages? We shall check this on different screens.
• Accessibility and legibility: We shall look both at the automated test and
use our experience to assess how well designed the pages are. (The
«Fun page!» Is not part of "Accessibility"-assessment.) Your description
will assist us in understanding the choices you have made.
• Ease of maintenance: Is the code easy to maintain for a new developer?
Can someone else take over your work and modify, change, and further
develop this site using their IDE of choice (rather than the one you
used)? We shall look at the code itself. Is it well-structured and easy to
read? Are you following conventions for comments? Is the CSS well
organised with each element styled only once (if possible)? Is the
structural code (like boxes) separate from code that define the visuals?
Et cetera.
• The text "Short presentation of accessibility". Have you done an
automated test? Were you able to comprehend the results? Have you
reflected on accessibility beyond automated tests? And does the entire
site appear coherent, as a site of pages, rather than fragmented texts
without a common theme?
• We accept reuse of code from you obligatory assignments.
• If you reuse code from other resources, please no more than 5 lines of
code, and be sure to cite (include a comment to reference the original
resource or website).
• Remember not to include any personal information in the text, as these
are public sites and GitHub servers are located outside the GDPR/ EU
jurisdiction.
