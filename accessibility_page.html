            <div class="image1"><img src="/Images/KodeHtml.jpg" alt="A screenshot of HTML code">
                <figcaption>A screenshot of our code that we used to create this website.</figcaption>

            <div class="text1 left">
                <p>The group tested the code using the web browser extension WAVE, which is a web accessibility
                    evaluation
                    tool that you can use to test your website and how accessible it is for people with disabilities.
                    With
                    different types of disabilities there is different things to take into account when one is designing
                    a website.


                    What we did was that we checked each page as we made them, to ensure that they passed the
                    automated test.All errors and alerts were taken care of and changed then checked again. We repeated
                    this process until it didn’t detect any errors. But as the automated test also stated, it was still
                    necessary to do manual testing of the website. We tested this by navigating only through the
                    keyboard,
                    which worked very well. The screen reader also read the content and navigation on the website
                    without
                    any problems.</p>

            <h2 style>Checking, validating and making coding-choices for universal design</h2>
            <p>
                Apart from checking the Web accessibility we of course also used a HTML and CSS checker to validate our 
                codes from the different pages/documents we had in this project, to be sure that 
                none of them had any problemes or errors. 
            </p>

            <p> While we wanted to stay true to the theme we got from this final assignment and really create a site by and 
                for new students at OsloMet, like using OsloMet's visual color profile, we also had to think about Universal 
                Design and keep that in mind as we made coding choices. We have learned from several courses at OsloMet that 
                universal design is about creating a design that can be used by all people, no matter what disability they 
                might have, to the best extent possible. The choices we make when it comes to design and coding determines: 
                Who it can be used by and how many it can be used by. It is important to include 
                everyone, not only those without disabilities.
